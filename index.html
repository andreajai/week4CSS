        <!-- WE ARE HIDDING HERE, SO SHHHHH. 
         Here is a scope of some of my thoughts. I think when I first saw this I had a mini breakdown.
         Soooo, I stepped away from my computer and made some food.
         Now, I am in a way better mood. I am also eating ice cream.
         This totally gives me myspace vibes. Yes, I am from that era.
         I am going to try to have as much fun as I can with this. I find it difficult to fully digest.
         I will most likely be very silly, so I can cope. YAY.
         -->

        <h3>welcome to my dark space.</h3>
            
            <h2>dun dun dun</h2>

            <p>I would like to talk about two artist I recently discovered. Their names are <selection id="sounds">CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso</selection>.
                I came across their Tiny Desk concert they did for Latino Heritage Month.
                I truly was blown away by this performance! They're so many different sounds, genres
                combined to perfect this beautiful orchestra. I can’t even describe what I heard. 
                But it remined me a lot of a place <selection id=wavy>I LOVE TO GO TO.</selection> 
                There is this tiny, hole in the wall place in Bushwick that I love to go with my partner after a night out. 
                We like to the end the night here. When we go there our motive is to <selection id="boop">DANCE.</selection> 
                The DJ is sitting on a higher step at the right corner side of the room parallel to the bar. 
                There is one single red light that is lit above the DJ booth. 
                The whole time the crowd is <selection id="boop">DANCING.</selection> This is not a place where you stand on the side. 
                The music is always bumping. <selection id="sounds">Sometimes, I think its just a bunch of sounds.</selection> 
        </p>

        <h3>BOOP BI BOOP BA BOOP</h3>

            <p>I usually like to close my eyes and dance the whole time. My head is quiet during this time, 
                and I am focused on the sounds. When I saw the CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso tiny desk 
                concert I thought to myself <selection id="boop">WOW.</selection> This is what I love to listen to. I am so glad I came across it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I would like to describe their sound as a compilation of jazz, Latin trap, and <selection id="sounds">pure chaos.</selection> 
            Their song La Que Puede, Puede reminds me of the theme song of Cowboy Bebop. 
            <selection id="boop">SO GOOD.</selection>
        </p>
